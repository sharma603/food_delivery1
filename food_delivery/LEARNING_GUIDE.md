## What's Missing (Development Opportunities)

### 1. DocTypes (Core Data Models)
Your app currently has no DocTypes defined. For a food delivery app, you'll need:

**Essential DocTypes:**
- **Restaurant** - Store restaurant information
- **Menu Item** - Food items with prices, descriptions
- **Customer** - Customer information and preferences
- **Food Order** - Order details, items, quantities
- **Order Item** - Individual items in an order
- **Delivery** - Delivery information and tracking
- **Driver** - Delivery driver details
- **Payment** - Payment processing and records

### 2. Custom Fields and Views
- Custom fields for food-specific data
- List views for orders, deliveries
- Form views with food delivery workflows
- Calendar views for delivery schedules

### 3. API Endpoints
- REST API for mobile apps
- Webhook integrations
- Payment gateway integrations

### 4. Custom Scripts and Workflows
- Order processing automation
- Delivery assignment logic
- Payment processing
- Notification systems

## Learning Path for Food Delivery App Development

### Phase 1: Understanding ERPNext Basics
1. **Frappe Framework Concepts**
   - DocTypes and their structure
   - Fields and field types
   - Permissions and roles
   - Workflows and states

2. **ERPNext Core Modules**
   - Customer management
   - Item management
   - Sales and purchase
   - Accounting integration

### Phase 2: App Development Fundamentals
1. **Creating DocTypes**
   ```bash
   # Use Frappe's DocType builder
   bench --site your-site console
   ```

2. **Field Types for Food Delivery**
   - Link fields (Customer, Restaurant)
   - Table fields (Order Items)
   - Currency fields (Prices)
   - Date/Time fields (Delivery times)
   - Select fields (Order status)

3. **Custom Scripts**
   - Client-side JavaScript
   - Server-side Python
   - API methods

### Phase 3: Food Delivery Specific Features

#### 3.1 Restaurant Management
```python
# Example DocType structure for Restaurant
{
    "doctype": "Restaurant",
    "fields": [
        {"fieldname": "restaurant_name", "fieldtype": "Data"},
        {"fieldname": "address", "fieldtype": "Text"},
        {"fieldname": "phone", "fieldtype": "Data"},
        {"fieldname": "cuisine_type", "fieldtype": "Select"},
        {"fieldname": "delivery_radius", "fieldtype": "Float"},
        {"fieldname": "is_active", "fieldtype": "Check"}
    ]
}
```

#### 3.2 Menu Management
```python
# Example DocType structure for Menu Item
{
    "doctype": "Menu Item",
    "fields": [
        {"fieldname": "item_name", "fieldtype": "Data"},
        {"fieldname": "description", "fieldtype": "Text"},
        {"fieldname": "price", "fieldtype": "Currency"},
        {"fieldname": "category", "fieldtype": "Select"},
        {"fieldname": "restaurant", "fieldtype": "Link", "options": "Restaurant"},
        {"fieldname": "is_available", "fieldtype": "Check"},
        {"fieldname": "preparation_time", "fieldtype": "Int"}
    ]
}
```

#### 3.3 Order Management
```python
# Example DocType structure for Food Order
{
    "doctype": "Food Order",
    "fields": [
        {"fieldname": "customer", "fieldtype": "Link", "options": "Customer"},
        {"fieldname": "restaurant", "fieldtype": "Link", "options": "Restaurant"},
        {"fieldname": "order_date", "fieldtype": "Datetime"},
        {"fieldname": "delivery_address", "fieldtype": "Text"},
        {"fieldname": "order_status", "fieldtype": "Select"},
        {"fieldname": "total_amount", "fieldtype": "Currency"},
        {"fieldname": "items", "fieldtype": "Table", "options": "Order Item"}
    ]
}
```

### Phase 4: Advanced Features

#### 4.1 Real-time Updates
- WebSocket integration for live order tracking
- Push notifications for order status changes

#### 4.2 Payment Integration
- Payment gateway setup
- Multiple payment methods
- Refund processing

#### 4.3 Delivery Management

- Restaurant performance metrics

## Development Commands

### Basic Setup
```bash
# Install the app
bench get-app food_delivery
bench install-app food_delivery

# Start development server
bench start

# Create new DocType
bench --site your-site console
```

### Useful Development Commands
```bash
# Clear cache
bench clear-cache

# Restart services
bench restart

# Run migrations
bench migrate

# Create fixtures
bench make-fixtures

# Build assets
bench build
```

## Next Steps for Development

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Create your first DocType** - Start with Restaurant
2. **Set up basic fields** - Name, address, contact info
3. **Test the DocType** - Create, read, update, delete operations
4. **Add relationships** - Link restaurants to menu items

### Short-term Goals:
1. Complete all core DocTypes
2. Implement basic workflows
3. Create custom views and reports
4. Add API endpoints

### Long-term Goals:
1. Mobile app integration
2. Payment gateway integration
3. Advanced analytics
4. Multi-restaurant support
